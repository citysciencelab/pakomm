### Objectives
The PaKOMM project develops visualization tools and workflows that can be used by diverse actors in urban research. Through a collaborative and multimedia approach, a significant contribution is to be made to more effective and efficient decision-making in participation processes. The knowledge gained from this will also
have an influence on how the digital city of the future can look.

The project designs and tests application-specific, integrative solutions that - together with the use of mixed reality techniques and elements of gamification - enable added value in the participation process. With a focus on good design and usability, multimedia visualization forms are to be meaningfully combined and dynamically adapted to concrete participation tasks, collaboration scenarios and the end devices used.

Increased coverage will generate a larger amount of data on citizen contributions, which exceeds the evaluation capacities in the planning offices. Machine learning and natural language processing methods will be used to automate the evaluations of the participation processes in order to quickly extract the important core statements and critical points.

### Participation

Over the past 15 years, digital technologies and new methods have been increasingly incorporated into participation processes. The early, comprehensive and transparent involvement of city residents can create greater acceptance and enable more efficient processes. However, participation in citizens' decisions to date has not been representative, as young people in particular are not involved. Furthermore, the processes are characterized by a rather academic population. By focusing on design and usability, young, technology-savvy groups of people should be addressed as well as the older generation, which is increasingly using smartphones.

### Collaborative

Current methods of participation often rely either on onsite procedures, which invite participation on site, or on online procedures, which enable engagement independent of location and time. Integrated approaches, such as those developed in the DIPAS project of the City Science Lab (HCU) and the City of Hamburg, can prevent media discontinuities. The PaKOMM project also considers spatially separated/coincident, temporally synchronous/asynchronous
and moderated/unmoderated approaches to collaborative participation. The project ties in with current multi-user MR developments such as Collaborative Virtual Environments. To ensure that users only receive the information that is relevant for solving a specific task and to avoid distractions by details, meaningful
information depths are determined for a multi-scale approach. Typically, various forms of visualization (e.g., diagrams, aerial and satellite imagery, videos, or animations) are output on monitors, city scopes (interactive "data tables"), or, more recently, through mixed reality. So far, the use of these forms of display has been isolated. In this project, a combined use in the form of a parallel or sequential arrangement will be investigated.

This interdisciplinary project combines expertise from the fields of cartography/visualization, urban research (both HCU) and digital reality (HAW Hamburg) and is funded by the Hamburg Ministry of Science, Research and Equality (BWFG).
